// const heading = document.querySelector('.heading');
// const parent = heading.parentNode;
// console.log(parent)

// parentElement is new to Firefox 9 and to DOM4, but it has been present in all other major browsers for ages.

// In most cases, it is the same as parentNode. The only difference comes when a node's parentNode is not an element. If so, parentElement is null.
